"""This module shows efficient ways to generate lists for common patterns of data
It is really vital to keep this code to minimal and easy to read. 

This shows some common examples

The way it works is [ some_value for __ in ___] on any for loop

####### Advanced concept!!!
# Keep it to atmost 1 ternary operation otherwise becomes messy
# This is kinda messy so try and use the other tricks    
alternate_negatives = [(-1*val if index%2 == 0 else val) for index, val in enumerate(range(11))]
# alternate_negatives:      [0, 1, -2, 3, -4, 5, -6, 7, -8, 9, -10]
